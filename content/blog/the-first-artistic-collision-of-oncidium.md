First attempts always carry a sense of youthful anticipation and uncertainty. In 2023, when we decided to take a step forward and break away from the traditional framework surrounding Oncidium orchids, we had no clear direction in mind. Previously, our interactions had simply involved straightforward exchanges with growers and enthusiasts, never truly stepping into the world of floral artistry.

As time passed, we gradually realized that orchids—beautiful and profound as they are—seemed to be fading from the sight of the younger generation, leaving us feeling as though we were standing on the edge of being forgotten. Meanwhile, foliage plants flourished and became prevalent in urban life, amplifying the anxiety within us.

However, we clearly understood that trends come and go. Only by returning to our roots, adapting with flexibility, and maintaining resilience could we truly take this garden further.

This realization motivated our first attempt to enter the world of floral artists. We knew that only by first introducing ourselves and sharing the secrets behind the growth of Oncidium orchids could their beauty be presented fully and authentically to everyone.

Yet, the journey wasn't smooth. After directly interacting with various industry insiders, we discovered the distance between ideals and reality was far greater than anticipated. Nevertheless, we didn't retreat. Instead, we became more determined to bridge these gaps and bring the beauty of Oncidium orchids closer to people's daily lives.

After numerous efforts, we connected with [Firework](https://www.instagram.com/firework.florist/) located in Neihu, Taipei. Initially, we simply wanted to inquire about consignment possibilities, but Firework’s owner, Xiao An, with her unique perspective, opened a new window for us. She envisioned orchids as a kind of "switch," gently opening the door to people's imaginations through artistic expressions.

Indeed, mere commerce might not integrate orchids into daily life effectively. However, art quietly narrows the gap between growers and consumers, allowing people to slowly savor each flower's subtle beauty.

Through this interaction, our own artistic vision was awakened. Perhaps we don't need to impose traditional approaches; instead, we can quietly invite people into the world of orchids through beautiful encounters.

To us, this wasn't just a new attempt—it was an inspiring awakening. Our imaginations about flowers, art, and life began to flow gently, blooming softly ever since.
