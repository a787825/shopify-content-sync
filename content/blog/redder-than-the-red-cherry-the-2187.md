When the _Hwuluduen 'Red Cherry'_ officially reaches maturity, we begin to explore ways to unlock even more possibilities. The newly discovered variety, _2187_, might just be the answer. It offers an earlier blooming period.  
  

In central of Taiwan,Â _2187_ can start its red _Oncidium_ blooming season as early as the beginning of December. Following this, the red cherry blossoms continue blooming from February until March of the following year.  
  
This means a continuous display of red flowers throughout this period. Additionally, _2187_ exhibits excellent heat tolerance and robust growth characteristics, making it highly adaptable to various environmental conditions. Compared to the original _Red Cherry_, the flowers of _2187_ have a brighter and more vivid coloration.  
  

Moving forward, we will continue our research on this new variety. Our ultimate goal is to achieve year-round flower production.
