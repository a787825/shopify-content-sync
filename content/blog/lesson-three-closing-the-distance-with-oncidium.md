The [Kamaro’an](https://www.instagram.com/kamaroan.studio?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) exhibition is just the beginning of this journey. As the special sponsor for this new product launch, I was delighted to witness [Yuty](https://www.instagram.com/yuty_deco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Yuty_deco instagram")’s unique Oncidium orchid creation class. The charming elegance of the Oncidium orchid was on full display, and everyone discovered its endless potential in floral art creation—it was all filled with surprise and inspiration.

Honestly, that morning I was stuck in Taipei’s traffic, circling those quirky roundabouts, feeling a bit anxious. But the moment I stepped into the store, the calm atmosphere and the beaming smiles of the students made me feel like I’d stepped into another world. Their focused eyes and the light air of curiosity—they all seemed so eager to learn. [Yuty](https://www.instagram.com/yuty_deco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Yuty_deco instagram") began with an introduction to the background of the Oncidium orchid, explaining each detail with care. From the looks on everyone’s faces, I’m pretty sure they all understood—or at least, their smiles said they did.

The second half of the class brought a fun twist. [Yuty](https://www.instagram.com/yuty_deco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Yuty_deco instagram") led everyone into a small Oncidium garden, letting them personally select the flowers for their creations. It was amusing to watch how some started off shy and hesitant, but soon found themselves deeply immersed in the act of picking and gathering flowers. Back at their seats, [Yuty](https://www.instagram.com/yuty_deco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Yuty_deco instagram") guided them step by step—how to trim, arrange, and finally place the Oncidium orchid on their designated pottery. Her patient explanations filled the room, and the atmosphere was buzzing with creativity. Everyone was busy crafting in their own unique way, creating a scene that was both professional and a little heartwarming.

When the students finally completed their creations, those vibrant and beautiful floral pieces on display made me, as the sponsor, feel an overwhelming sense of pride. It wasn’t just about finishing an event—it was about seeing the Oncidium orchid come to life in each person’s hands. That’s where the real magic lies. The beauty of the Oncidium orchid was no longer just a still life but became something reborn through each individual’s creation.

Seeing how beautifully the Oncidium orchid was showcased in this event, I sometimes wonder if we should make the event even bigger. But then, the thought of moving so many flowers around seems a bit daunting. Through this class, more people got to know and appreciate the beauty of the Oncidium orchid, and I think that’s what we set out to achieve. While the orchid wasn’t the sole star of the event, the feelings and inspiration it brought were irreplaceable.
