## **Origin of Hwuluduen 'Passion**

'Passion' was developed with the intention of creating a beautiful orchid that is also easy to grow. By merging the elegant, colorful qualities of **Miltonia** with the hardy, flowering endurance of **Oncidium**, 'Passion' offers the best of both worlds. The hybridization process was meticulously planned to produce a plant that thrives with minimal care while producing an abundance of visually appealing flowers. It is important to note that 'Passion's' flowers are significantly larger than those of typical Oncidium varieties, reaching **three to four times the size** of standard Oncidium blooms, though it produces fewer flowers and branches—likely due to its **Miltonia** lineage.

## **'Passion's Dynamic Hues**

One of the standout features of 'Passion' is its deep purple petals, which change hues depending on lighting conditions. Under brighter light, the flowers reveal a vibrant purple, while in dimmer settings, the petals take on a more mysterious, subdued tone. This dynamic color display adds a layer of visual intrigue, while the symbolism of purple—associated with royalty, mystery, and dignity—enhances the appeal of 'Passion' in any setting.  
  

## **Cultivating 'Passion'**

'Passion' thrives best in a bark-based growing medium. It should be watered only when the medium dries out, as the orchid's root system is adept at storing water, making it quite drought-tolerant. In terms of nutrition, bi-weekly foliar fertilization using a balanced, water-soluble orchid fertilizer is recommended. This ensures healthy growth and abundant flowering, making 'Passion' an ideal orchid for both beginners and seasoned growers. Despite its ability to tolerate strong sunlight, it's still best to provide **bright, indirect light** for optimal growth.

## **'Passion's Versatility :**

Unlike traditional **Oncidiums**, 'Passion' offers medium-sized flowers that resemble the graceful blooms of **Miltonia**. The flowers are densely packed, creating a lush, full display. However, compared to typical Oncidium varieties, 'Passion' produces fewer flowers and has less branching, which may be attributed to its Miltonia heritage. This versatility makes 'Passion' a perfect addition to any floral arrangement or home decor, showcasing the beauty of hybridization. Its ability to thrive with minimal care while offering a striking floral display marks a significant advancement in orchid cultivation.
