Starting in 2024, We aim to make the use of Oncidium more refined and efficient. Through a friend's introduction, we connected with [Yuty\_deco](https://www.instagram.com/yuty_deco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Yuty_deco"). Our initial visit and discussion led to the first lifestyle workshop and arrangement featuring Oncidium. Although the golden age of orchids in Taiwan has passed, these flowers are rarely seen in everyday life, usually appearing only in special hotel lobbies or festive occasions.

  

  

After the first visit, we received Yuty's ideas and quickly took action. Using April's seasonal Oncidium flowers, some seedling varieties Hwuluduen 2185 and 2172, and native species, we completed our first sensory and on-ground arrangement at [Kamaro’an](https://www.instagram.com/kamaroan.studio?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw== "Kamaro'an").

Previously, we had never stepped out of our so-called circles, including the garden, the echo chamber, and enthusiasts' groups. These circles were tightly closed, making them hard to approach. This may be one of the reasons why the orchid world lost connection with the post-90s generation, losing attention and new enthusiasts.

Active development and exposure have become necessary. We must step out of the cultivation frame, letting the new generation understand that Oncidium orchids are neither fragile nor difficult to care for. We need to deeply reflect on why orchids lost their original appeal to this generation. Has excessive commercialization weakened the appreciation value of Oncidium orchids? Has overprotection limited the flowers to being viewed only in greenhouses?

We began our first cross-disciplinary activity, letting everyone know that Oncidium orchids can be more attractive not only in pots but also when arranged on the ground. Through this shared lifestyle workshop, we hope to bring orchids back into everyone's view. This process may be long, but it will definitely be engaging. The first class was not only the beginning of incorporating Oncidium orchids into arrangements but also a significant step in our journey to re-plan and redefine this art form.
