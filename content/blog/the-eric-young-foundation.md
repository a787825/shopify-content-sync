## Origins and Establishment

Eric Young, originally from Derbyshire, moved to Jersey in the 1950s. A successful entrepreneur and philanthropist, he developed a lifelong passion for orchids. In the early 1980s, he laid the groundwork for the **Eric Young Orchid Foundation (EYOF)**, envisioning it as a center dedicated to orchid cultivation and hybridization. Following his passing, the Foundation was formally established to preserve and continue his legacy. Since then, it has grown into a world-renowned institution focused on the development of new orchid hybrids and public education.

## Legacy and Global Influence

The influence of the Eric Young Orchid Foundation extends far beyond the Channel Islands. It has profoundly shaped the direction of orchid hybridization around the world— **including our own journey at Hwuluduen Orchids**.

The history of **Hwuluduen Orchids** has been massively impacted by the Eric Young Foundation. Several of our _Oncidium_ varieties were derived from crosses involving Eric Young’s hybrids. In the past, _Oncidium_ breeding often followed a singular path—emphasizing small flowers, tall spikes, and a high flower count. However, inspired by EYOF’s innovative work, we began experimenting with crossings between _Odontoglossum_ (now classified under _Oncidium_) and traditional _Oncidium_ lines.

The result was transformative. These hybrids brought about **significant changes in flower morphology**—from enhanced color variations and refined shapes to an explosion of genetic diversity. This opened new directions in our breeding goals and inspired broader experimentation in tropical and subtropical breeding programs worldwide.

## Hybridization and Achievements

The EYOF has made lasting contributions to orchid hybridization, particularly with genera such as _Oncidium_, _Cymbidium_, _Phragmipedium_, and _Paphiopedilum_. Their breeding program has produced nearly **450 Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) awards**, a testament to the quality and vision behind their work.

*   **Cymbidium Hybrids:** Cultivars like _'Icho Tower'_ and _'Victor Hugo'_ broadened the color spectrum and elevated flower quality across the genus.
*   **Phragmipedium Advances:** Pioneering hybrids with _P. kovachii_ led to iconic cultivars such as _Phragmipedium La Vingtaine 'Victoria Village'_, awarded an RHS Award of Merit.

## Facilities and Public Engagement

The EYOF’s purpose-built display facility offers year-round floral displays with curated rotations of blooming orchids. These exhibitions showcase the Foundation's expansive collection and educate visitors on the biodiversity of orchid genera. Behind the scenes, the Foundation maintains specialized growing houses for hybridization and conservation, making it both a public attraction and a research hub.

## Educational and Conservation Mission

Beyond its breeding achievements, the Foundation is committed to conservation and public education. By curating a living archive of orchid species and hybrids, EYOF ensures that rare and endangered orchids are preserved for future generations. Workshops and learning programs invite students, enthusiasts, and experts alike to engage with the science and artistry of orchid cultivation.
