Nestled in the alleys of Daan District, Taipei, Kamaro’an awaited our floral arrangement days before the event. Yuty's creative use of Oncidium orchids exceeded our expectations, deepening our understanding of these beautiful blooms. As producers and sponsors, our initial imagination of Oncidium orchids was limited, lacking sensory stimulation and aesthetic vision. Over three days, we transformed these visions into reality, relying solely on our intuition for beauty, without sketches.

On the event day, stepping into Kamaro’an's store, you could feel the serene ambiance despite the crowd. Sunlight streamed through the windows, softly illuminating the floor and casting shadows of Oncidium orchids on Kamaro’an’s new woven bags.

Following the path of light, you gradually entered the store. In a corner against the wall, Oncidium orchids harmoniously coexisted with woven baskets and handmade textiles, their colors blending perfectly. Sunlight highlighted these objects, making their colors stand out. Pausing beside a wooden chair, you felt the simplicity of the aesthetics, as if time slowed down here.

Continuing towards the window at the end, the Oncidium orchids caught your eye again. This area resembled a ground-level garden, with clusters of flowers arranged together, each petal strikingly prominent. Sunlight gently bathed these plants through the glass, with the angle of the light enhancing the contrast, creating a sense of natural harmony.

From my perspective, you would suddenly realize that Oncidium orchids are far more than mere decorations. Through them, each ray of light beautifully highlights Kamaro’an's culture and heritage. Every craft piece here becomes more vibrant with the presence of Oncidium orchids, infusing every corner with a sense of poetry and spirituality.

You have experienced the unique charm of Oncidium orchids, with no need to overly emphasize their significance—just embrace the warmth of nature. This is the feeling we seem to be constantly pursuing. At Hulu-Tun Orchid Garden, we never believe Oncidium orchids need to stand out on their own; we focus more on their harmonious coexistence with everything around them.
