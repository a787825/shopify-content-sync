Sunlight gently streams through the large windows, and Oncidium orchids stand quietly in every corner of the workshop. They don’t demand attention, yet they fill the space with a gentle vitality. The environment created by Kamaro'an and Yuty feels like an extension of nature, with greenery subtly flowing throughout.

The Oncidium orchids are not deliberately eye-catching; they appear as secondary players casually placed in handmade vases, harmonizing with other elements. You may not notice them at first glance, but their presence completes the space. Their understated elegance, paired with marble vases and white pebbles, creates a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere.

Kamaro'an, a name that means "Come here and sit" in the indigenous tribe, feels like a warm invitation from family. They infuse this sense of belonging into their designs, weaving traditional tribal craft with modern aesthetics into every intricate detail of their creations.

The event also offers people the opportunity to interact more deeply with these designs and plants. In the flower arrangement workshops, Oncidium orchids may not always take center stage, but their delicate accents often surprise participants. The handmade vases, carrying Yuty’s personal story, silently communicate with the orchids, creating an unspoken dialogue within the space.

The entire event is free from overly extravagant decor, and the Oncidium orchids don’t need to be the focal point. They simply exist, quietly present like a friend by your side, helping you find a sense of peace within the calmness of the moment.
