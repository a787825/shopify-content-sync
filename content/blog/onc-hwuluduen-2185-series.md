> Oncidium Hwuluduen '2185' is a hybrid whose progeny are very diverse, but no distinctive variety has yet been selected. This hybrid has inherited the excellent characteristics of its parent, Onc. Hwuluduen Spinel, such as ease of cultivation and strong environmental adaptability, providing flower farmers with a lower threshold for cultivation costs.

## Yellow flowers and patterns pattern diversity

      
    The most striking feature of this variety is the yellow flowers, which account for approximately 80% of the entire collection. However, it has a variety of flower shapes and patterns, which makes the yellow flowers not monotonous. Under the high-standard breeding strategy, although yellow is the main color, changes in flower shape and pattern increase the commercial value. This makes it a premium choice in the cut flower market.

## Flowering period characteristics and breeding process

     Oncidium Hwuluduen '2185' blooms from May to July. This feature provides advantages in prediction and screening, and contributes to the efficiency of breeding operations in concurrent screening comparisons. However, the advantage of concentrated flowering period also means that stability may cause it to lose some of the advantages of being able to bloom all year round.

## Growth potential and pedicel characteristics

  
    '2185' has excellent growth potential, and most of its varieties can maintain good growth in high temperature and high humidity environments. Its flower strips are particularly long and hard, with multi-branch characteristics. The flower shape is medium to slightly small, which is obviously different from the common lime green flowers. Lemon green flowers are usually bright yellow and simple in shape with short flower strips.

**  
We are still observing the suitable traits and characteristics that can make 2185 purchase more outstanding. This type of variety will not enter everyone's eyes too quickly, but may be released slowly, but we expect it to be released after some screening. Select distinctive traits and sell them as seedlings, so that everyone can feel its charm more
