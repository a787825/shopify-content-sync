## 1.  Characteristics of Cut Flowers and Potted Plants

### Cut Flower Variety

Cut flowers are mainly cut from planted oncidiums, and the freshness of the flowers is maintained through the pedicels absorbing water on their own. The cut flower varieties are mainly thin-leaf varieties, with straight stems and tightly or sparsely arranged flowers. Typical varieties include ‘Honey Angel’, ‘Son of the Sun’ and ‘Red Cherry’. The grading standard of these varieties in Taiwan is based on the length of the flower stem. The longer the flower stem, the higher the quality grade. Cut flowers are mainly supplied to the international market, with Japan as the main export destination, and the domestic market demand is relatively small.

### Pot Flower Variety

The advantage of using potted flowers is that they can be used in whole pots. The varieties of potted flowers are mainly thick-leaved, with rich and diverse colors, and some varieties also have fragrance. However, limited by marketing and production, potted flowers have low visibility in the domestic market. Since potted flowers have a root system, they are suitable for a wider range of application scenarios, such as home gardening, commercial space decoration, etc.

## 3\. Market demand and business value

### Cut Flower Market

Taiwan is an important supplier of cut flowers to the world, especially exporting to the Japanese market. According to statistics, cut flowers exported to Japan account for more than 70% of Taiwan's total foreign sales. Although the demand in the domestic market is limited, with the maturity of the floral market and the development of lifestyle, cut flowers are expected to expand into more application scenarios.

### Pot Flower Market

Although the external sales of potted plants are relatively low, and attention is not paid to oncidium, with the rise of urban gardening and small greening trends, we feel that market demand should increase year by year. These major export markets include the United States, the European Union, Japan, Singapore and China, and have the potential for stable growth. In the future, as consumers' demand for personalization and uniqueness increases, the potted flower market will continue to expand.
