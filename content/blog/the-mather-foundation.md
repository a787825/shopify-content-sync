> Dedicated to Orchid Conservation, Research, and Breeding

## Origins and Breeding Initiatives

Founded in 2019, The Mathers Foundation is a UK-based charity focused on orchid conservation, particularly the Oncidium genus. Located near Pulborough, West Sussex, the Foundation operates modern glasshouses with advanced automation and a carbon-neutral heating system, ensuring optimal growth conditions.

Initially, the Foundation sourced breeding stock from the Eric Young Orchid Foundation in Jersey. By 2020, they expanded their collection with additional material from Ecuador and Colombia, enabling hybridization and preservation of both traditional and modern orchid cultivars.

## National Plant Collections and Recognitions

The Mathers Foundation holds five of the UK's National Plant Collections:

*   **Oncidium**
*   **Pleione**
*   **Stanhopea**
*   **Masdevallia**
*   **Anguloa**

In recognition of their conservation efforts, the Foundation received the prestigious Brickell Award in 2024 at the RHS Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival.

## Oncidium Orchids: A Focus on Conservation

The genus _Oncidium_, often called "dancing-lady orchids" due to their petal shape, comprises approximately 340 species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These epiphytic orchids grow on other plants but do not extract nutrients from them.

The Mathers Foundation is committed to preserving the genetic diversity of _Oncidium_ through careful breeding and conservation programs.

## Recent Developments and Community Engagement

The Foundation actively engages with the orchid community by:

*   Launching an Etsy shop for official products supporting conservation initiatives.
*   Organizing Open Days and Events for 2025 to showcase their collections.

Through its dedication to research, conservation, and community involvement, The Mathers Foundation plays a crucial role in safeguarding orchid biodiversity for future generations.
