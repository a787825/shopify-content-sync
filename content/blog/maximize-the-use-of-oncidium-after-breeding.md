> ### At Hwuluduen Orchids, we constantly think about how to unlock the greater commercial value of flowers that were not selected during the breeding process. Currently, our farm offers three main types of products: variety potted plants, seedling potted plants, and experimental cut flowers. Each product has its unique characteristics, aimed at meeting the diverse needs of the market.

# **Product Introduction:**

## Potted Plant Types

**Variety Potted Plants**

Variety potted plants are carefully selected orchids with strong vitality and excellent blooming performance. These potted plants are easy to care for and are produced in large quantities, making them a popular choice for consumers. They are especially appealing to orchid enthusiasts and florists.

**Seedling Potted Plants**

Seedling potted plants are flowers that were not selected during the breeding process. While they do not meet the standards of variety potted plants, each one has unique characteristics. Their genetic traits may be less stable, which adds to their charm. These potted plants are relatively affordable and are ideal for customers seeking unique flowers.

## Cut Flower Types

**Experimental Cut Flowers**

Experimental cut flowers are a small quantity of flowers that were not selected during the auction process. These flowers may have a shorter blooming period but possess distinctive characteristics with potential to explore the market. For customers interested in novelty products, these cut flowers are worth trying.

Our goal is to leverage the long blooming period of Oncidium orchids to maintain an extended display period for both cut flowers and potted plants. One of the benefits of Oncidium orchids is their ability to bloom year-round, even during the typically slow bloom season of August to September. Therefore, we aim to promote Oncidium orchids as a reliable option in the floral market due to their easy care and long blooming period.

## **Pricing and Shipping Challenges:**

Our breeding cycle is longer, which makes our product prices higher than typical orchids. However, our flowers are highly competitive in terms of quantity and variety changes. In the past, we attempted to ship products to the northern regions. While the flowers performed well during the winter, the loss rate was too high during the spring, summer, and autumn. As a result, we decided to focus on central Taiwan as our primary market to ensure product quality and customer satisfaction. Cold-chain logistics is a potential solution, but challenges such as product recovery and unsold inventory still exist, requiring us to find more effective solutions.

## **Market Development Potential:**

We see great potential for flowers in daily life and believe there is still significant room for development. However, due to price and shelf-life constraints, floral aesthetics have not been widely promoted in Taiwan. We hope to break this situation with Oncidium orchids. Oncidium orchids not only have a long blooming period and are easy to care for, but they also enter the market at a relatively affordable price, allowing more people to enjoy the beauty of flowers.

## **Collaboration Proposal:**

We are currently seeking businesses interested in seedling potted Oncidium orchids and experimental cut flowers to collaborate on this new sales model. While our products are priced higher, their uniqueness is second to none in Taiwan. Although our focus is on the central market, we are also open to collaboration proposals from other regions.

Previously, we have worked with several florists to host concept events, including art displays and hands-on workshops. These events are not just “concepts,” but aim to establish deeper connections. Therefore, our collaboration goes beyond simple sales and explores the diverse applications of Oncidium orchids in the market.

Through this innovative approach, we hope to maximize the value of orchids from the breeding process, meet various market demands, increase product value, and help expand our market, boost brand recognition, and achieve sustainable business development.
